Congestion tax is charged for vehicles passing a toll station Monday to Friday between 06:00 and 18:29. 
Tax is not charged on Saturdays, public holidays, days before public holidays, or during the month of July. 
Some vehicles are exempt from congestion tax. A car that passes several toll stations within 60 minutes is only taxed once. 
The amount to be paid in such cases is the highest amount among those passages.


Introduction
Code test

Task
The goal is to create an application for managing the tolls in Gothenburg along with calculating fees for vehicles.

There are no direct syntax errors; it's more about structure and general programming skills not specific to any language. There is room for a variety of improvements – we want you to think about what changes and additions you would make to get a code that you "stand by".

Timeframe
No deadline, but please submit the result within 7-10 days.
