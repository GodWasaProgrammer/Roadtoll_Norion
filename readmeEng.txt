Introduction
Code test

Task
The goal is to create an application to manage the tolls in Gothenburg with associated fee calculation for vehicles.

There are no direct syntax errors, but it's more about structure and general programming skills that are not specific to any language. There is room for a variety of improvements – we want you to consider what changes and additions you want to make to get a code that you "stand by".

Timeframe
No deadline, but submit a result within 7-10 days.

Submission
Upload the solution to your own GitHub so we can follow the commit history.

Congestion charges are imposed on vehicles passing a toll station Monday to Friday between 06:00 and 18:29.
No charges are imposed on Saturdays, public holidays, the day before a public holiday, or during the month of July.
Some vehicles are exempt from congestion charges. A car that passes several toll stations within 60 minutes is only charged once. 
The amount to be paid is the highest amount of those passages.
